What is the MERN Stack?  
A full-stack JavaScript-based framework:
MERN: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js
MongoDB: NoSQL database.
Express.js: Backend framework.
React.js: Frontend library.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime.
The MERN stack is popular because it enables full-stack development using JavaScript, making development faster and more efficient.

How AI Complements MERN? 
Its Adds intelligence to web applications.
AI can enhance MERN apps by enabling features like chatbots , recommendations and data analysis.

Objective of AI:
Build smarter, scalable web apps using MERN and AI.
The primary objective of using AI with MERN is to build smarter, scalable, and user-friendly applications that can provide personalized user experiences, automate tasks, and enhance app functionality

What AI Tools can do for us	
Code Completion: Auto-complete lines of code using tools like Codeium.
Code Documentation: Generate inline documentation for better code readability.
Multi-language Support: Translate code snippets across languages.
Debugging: Highlight syntax errors or suggest fixes during coding.
Chat Features: Chat with AI assistants like ChatGPT.
User Testing: Test app functionality with users.
Security and Vulnerability Testing: Analyze code for security vulnerabilities.

Is AI-Treat?
No	Instead, as a coder or programmer, you should embrace AI and learn to integrate it into your development practice. Software developers, specifically those who work in AI, create tools meant to make life easier. 		

Right Now, we have many AI Tools
Tabnine	
Codeium	
Google Gemini	
Chat GPT	
CoPilot

Out of you all have used many of them and today we will be exploring Codeium

Today, we will focus on Codeium because it offers free AI-powered code completion and chat assistance, making it accessible to all developers

Go to the Extension Marketplace.
Search and install Codeium.
Authenticate with your account and click Allow.

Now let us create a react project using vite and use our Codeium AutoSuggestion and Chat

In AI Tools,Most important is how we provide the Prompt
Its nowadays called as Prompt Enginnering

Prompt Engineering is a technique to guide the AI to the right direction with the right context and also Refines your prompts iteratively by analyzing the AI's response and adjusting the input for better results

Key Concepts of Prompt Engineering
1-Clarity:

Provide clear and concise instructions.
Example: Instead of "Tell me about React,
>>"Explain React, focusing on its component-based architecture and state management."

2-Context:
Add context to the prompt for tailored responses and improves Accuracy
Example: "I am Fan of JavaScript" >> So this means i am saying in context of javascript not above the Fan which i have.

3-Structure:

Use structured prompts to get specific outputs.
Example:
Task: "Generate task suggestions."
Input: "Create a meeting plan."

Expected Output:"1. Book a conference room.
                 2. Send calendar invites. 
                 3. Prepare slides."

Best Practices in Prompt Engineering
Use step-by-step instructions for complex tasks.
Include examples for better context.
Iteratively refine prompts for improved accuracy.

"The Future of AI
"	Great!	Artificial intelligence isn’t going anywhere. More and more AI tools are being created and updated to help with the simple and advanced tasks that come with web development. And no matter how great AI can be, it won’t replace the skills you’ll need for a successful career as a web developer
