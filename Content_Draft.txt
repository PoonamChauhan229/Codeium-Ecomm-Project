What is the MERN Stack?  
A full-stack JavaScript-based framework:
MERN: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js
MongoDB: NoSQL database.
Express.js: Backend framework.
React.js: Frontend library.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime.

How AI Complements MERN? 
Its Adds intelligence to web applications.

Objective of AI:
Build smarter, scalable web apps using MERN and AI.

What AI Tools can do for us	
Code completion and generation
Code documentation	
Multi-language support	
Third-party integrations	
Debugging code	
Chat features	
User testing	
Security and vulnerability testing

Is AI-Treat?
No	Instead, as a coder or programmer, you should embrace AI and learn to integrate it into your development practice. Software developers, specifically those who work in AI, create tools meant to make life easier. 		

Right Now, we have many AI Tools
Tabnine	
Codeium	
Google Gemini	
Chat GPT	
CoPilot

Out of you all have used many of them and today we will be exploring Codeium

So let us install Codeium
EXtention Market >> Install Codeium and it will ask for Authentication
Then click on Allow

Now let us create a react project and use our Codeium AutoSuggestion and Chat

In AI Tools,Most important is how we provide the Prompt
Its nowadays called as Prompt Enginnering

Prompt Engineering is a technique to guide the AI to the right direction with the right context.

Key Concepts of Prompt Engineering
1-Clarity:

Provide clear and concise instructions.
Example: Instead of "Tell me about React,
>>"Explain React, focusing on its component-based architecture and state management."

2-Context:
Add context to the prompt for tailored responses and improves Accuracy
Example: "I am Fan of JavaScript" >> So this means i am saying in context of javascript not above the Fan which i have.

3-Structure:

Use structured prompts to get specific outputs.
Example:
Task: "Generate task suggestions."
Input: "Create a meeting plan."

Expected Output:"1. Book a conference room.
                 2. Send calendar invites. 
                 3. Prepare slides."

Best Practices in Prompt Engineering
Use step-by-step instructions for complex tasks.
Provide examples in the prompt for better context.
Ask the model to infer the task without examples.
